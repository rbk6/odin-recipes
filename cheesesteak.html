        <h2>The BEST Cheesesteak You'll Ever Eat</h2>
        <p>This is an easy, delicious sandwich recipe that can be done in only 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>You can cook on a griddle, <em>which I personally recommend</em>, a stove-top, or flat cooktop.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Serves 4</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb Ribeye Steak <em>(trimmed and thinly sliced)</em></li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Seasalt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Black Pepper</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Oil <em>(i.e. Olive, Canola, whatever you prefer)</em></li>
            <li>1 White Onion <em>(diced)</em></li>
            <li>1 Green Bell Pepper <em>(diced)</em></li>
            <li>8 Slices of White American Cheese</li>
            <li>4 Hoagie Rolls <em>(sliced 3/4 through)</em></li>
            <li>2 tbsp Unsalted Butter <em>(softened)</em></li>
            <li>1 Garlic Clove <em>(pressed)</em></li>
            <li>2 tbsp Mayonnaise</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice hoagie rolls 3/4 of the way through with a <strong>serrated knife</strong>. Dice onions
            and thinly slice beef.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together 2 tbsp softened butter with 1 pressed garlic clove. Spread garlic butter
            onto the cut sides of the 4 hoagie rolls. Toast the buns on a griddle, stove-top, or flat cooktop on medium
            heat until <strong>golden brown</strong>, then set aside.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp of oil to the pan/cooktop and <em>sautee</em> the diced onions and green pepper until caramelized then
            transfer to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Increase to high heat, <em>adding 1 tbsp of oil</em>, and spread the thinly sliced steak in an even layer. Let brown
            for a couple of minutes <strong>undisturbed</strong>, then flip and season with 1/2 tsp salt and pepper. <em>Sautee</em>
            until steak is fully cooked through, then stir in the caramelized onions and green bell peppers</li>
            <li>Divide into 4 even portions and top each with 2 slices of cheese and turn off the heat so the cheese will melt without 
            overcooking the meat.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of mayo on the toasted side of each roll. Working with one portion at a time, place a toasted bun
            over each portion and use a spatula to scrape the cheesy beef into the bun as you flip it over. <strong>Serve warm</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
