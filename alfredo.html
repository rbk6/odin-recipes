        <h2>Nothing beats a great bowl of pasta</h2>
        <p>This classic take of Alfredo only takes 25 minutes to prepare.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Serves 4</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>Black Pepper</li>
            <li>12 oz. Fettuccine</li>
            <li>12 oz. Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breast</li>
            <li>1 Stick Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>2 cups Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp Freshly Grated Nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Freshly Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta and cook according
            to package directions until al dente (tender but still slightly firm). Drain and toss with
            a splash of oil.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips, and lay them on a plate or a sheet
            of waxed paper. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts,
            raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces,
            until the underside has browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and cooked
            through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the
            skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted,
            whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat
            to keep the sauce just warm.</li>
            <li>Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and cooked pasta and toss well.
            Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls.</li>
        </ol>
